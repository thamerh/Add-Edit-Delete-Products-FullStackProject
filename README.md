# Add-Edit-Delete-Products-FullStackProject

Nowadays basic CRUD functionality is used in basically every application on the web. Most know how easy it is to store basic data types in databases, but with the more apps I have built the more I have seen how prevalent media types are in database storage and how most apps could put use to them. So let's look at how we can store a single image or multiple images in a database and then retrieve them to display.

# Technologies
- React
- Node
- Express
- Multer
- mysql
- sequelize

We will build a basic React front end with a file picker as our interface to post to the backend. For the backend we will use Node with express to create an API that will interact with Mysql database , to store our images.
